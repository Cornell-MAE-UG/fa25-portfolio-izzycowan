For a fluids and heat transfer class, my group and I were challenged to work as a team to design a wind turbine blade that optimized criteria of our choice. This challenge was a test of our knowledge of theoretical aerodynamics as well as our experimental design and data analysis skills, all of which we built up throughout lectures and labs during the semester.

Our team first analyzed a blade designed in a previous year that experienced catastrophic failure to determine why it failed and what we needed to avoid in our design to make our blade safe. Next, we chose blade-generated power as our quantity to optimize, and chose an arbitrary operational RPM (# rotations per minute) to optimize to. We determined the angle of attack that would maximize the lift-to-drag ratio of our blade and designed the twist of the blade such that it maintained that angle of attack throughout the blade, while also making the blade short enough that the aerodynamic forces generated would not compromise safety.

We designed a testing procedure to see how the wind turbine would perform under typical conditions in our lab's largest wind tunnel. We operated the wind tunnel as well as a lab virtual instrument to gather power and RPM data for several wind speeds. This data was then plotted and compared to our theoretical calculations to critically analyze the blades' performance and factors that might improve our theoretical model.

Throughout this project, I focused largely on the experimental procedure, especially adapting it when we realized our theoretical model did not accurately model internal resistances, as well as ensuring we followed proper safety procedures to ensure our turbine did not endanger itself or lab equipment. I also considered future improvements to both our blade design and theoretical model based on the results of our experiment.
